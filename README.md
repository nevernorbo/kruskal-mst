# Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm in Golang

##### Graph theory project (2024)
---
#### About the project

This is my implementation of Kruskal's algorithm written in golang.

The project contains a main.go file in the root directory which serves as the entrypoint of the commandline application. It uses two small packages, one implementing the graph (the ./kruskal/kruskal.go file) and the algorithm itself, and the other defining the disjoint-set (also known as union-find in the disjoint_set.go file) data structure.


#### Execution

I included the compiled binaries for both linux and windows systems.

- Linux: `kruskal-mst`
- Windows: `kruskal-mst.exe`

Which can both be found on the root level of the repository.
